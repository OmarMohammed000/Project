<div class="card-body">
   <p> Since the establishment of Nova Academy in 1987, our mission has not only been about offering just an academic program to our students, but it has also been about building their characters and raising them in a healthy and balanced community to be eligible academically, cognitively, spiritually and physically. By doing so, Nozha Language Schools offers to the community a citizen who is capable of respecting individual differences on a cultural, social and religious level.</p>

<p>
On our path to achieve our mission, we depend on qualified teachers and we utilize the latest technological tools to integrate them into the educational system. However, we are aware that this cannot stand alone to help in raising a citizen who is successful and efficient to his community. Therefore, the thing that we believe in the most is that every student has his own talent and has an individual skill that needs to be discovered and developed. For each one is characterized by an original critical mind and needs to be encouraged to reach his biggest dream that requires support to be achieved.

<p> 
In correlation with our mission, we instill in our children/students the sense of belief in their social responsibilities towards their families and their community to inculcate the spirit of belonging to their homeland

    <p>
        In 1984, we took steps towards establishing an academic institution that aims at raising a generation with a valued academic level that is based on the ethics and the values of our culture and our community to help in the prosperity of our beloved country, Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the very beginning, the founders of the schools and the administration worked on providing all the tools and the facilities to reach their goals and aims in the educational process and in raising a better generation. Hence, they are always keen on hiring professional academic educators and are also keen on supplying the schools with the latest technological tools and integrating them into the educational process to lead the way to excellence in Egyptian private schools. For more than 35 years,Nova Academy has been the beacon of light that provides our country with leaders and innovators.
